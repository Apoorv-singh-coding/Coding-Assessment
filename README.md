Project Management - Coding Round
OVERVIEW
You will build a personal transportation conversion app. Follow this GitHub link to set up your repository with starter code. 
Follow the instructions in the included README.md to set up your development environment and to deploy a local Node.js+Express server running with starter code for your app. 
Youâ€™re welcome to change or remove some of the files already present in the starter code, or to remove and replace the starter code entirely, as long as we can still run your Express server when we grade your work.
GITHUB REPO LINK: 
Make sure to clone this github starter repository for the assignment: https://github.com/Apratim08/Cleanomatics-Coding-Assessment
INSTRUCTIONS
You are allowed to consult online resources, e.g. Stack Overflow, to get answers to specific implementation questions. 
You are not allowed to use AI programming assistants such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT. 
You have 48 hours to complete this assignment.
GOALS
Your application must have the following functionalities:
Distance to Time Conversion  - Allow a user to enter or choose the type of personal vehicle listed in the table below and a desired distance to travel. The user should see how much time it will take to complete their journey.
Compare All Options - The user should also be able to see and compare this result with the equivalent amount of time required to travel that distance for another vehicle. 
Check Fuel Efficiency: The user should be able to see the fuel consumption for the distance traveled. If the fuel consumption reaches max range, the result should show out of range. 
The landing page is the Vehicle Transport Converter. Follow the below design if you want, but you can choose to add your unique touch to it. Be creative!
Provide an input field for entering a distance and a radio button to select the type of electric transport.
Create a text element for showing the converted value (time to travel the given distance).
Provide a button that executes the calculation and updates the text with the converted value.

 Aesthetic - Provide good visuals and/or aesthetic iconography.
Range Limitations - As described in point 3, Provide a way to handle range limitations within the user interface.  For example, visual indication that a given user input distance is out of range of one or more specific transportation options.
Responsive Design - App design should adapt for usability in both mobile and desktop dimensions. (Hint: Use flexbox)
One-to-All Modes Comparison - Provide a way to set one transportation mode and communicate/visualize results in all other included transportation modes.
